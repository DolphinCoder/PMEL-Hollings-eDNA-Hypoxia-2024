There are three files missing from this folder because they are too large. 
1. OCNMS_COI_Data.csv
2. OCNMS_MiFish_Data.csv
3. FishPlusCOI_Reads.csv

They are very important, because they are the source of all the DNA data. 
If you are only interested in the same species of interest as the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary, you can skip to the OCNMS_Project folder and use All_SOI_IDs.csv, a filtered version of all of the reads. 
If not, you can access the full dataset by [emailing Zack? emailing Shannon? set up a file hosting thing?]
