There are three files missing from this folder because they are too large. 
1. OCNMS_COI_Data.csv
2. OCNMS_MiFish_Data.csv
3. FishPlusCOI_Reads.csv

They are very important, because they are the source of all the DNA data. 

To generate these files, you need to run eDNA_SampleData_Exploration.Rmd in OCNMS_sample_metadata_zjg/OCNMS before running any files in OCNMS_eDNA. This will take significant time and RAM if you are using a laptop.
